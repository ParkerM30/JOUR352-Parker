                    Stephen Curry’s favorite memory of playing against LeBron James isn’t from any of the three
                    championships he won with the Golden State Warriors against James’s teams. It was from his 2009-10
                    rookie season, when James was in his seventh year with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

                <p>
                    “For me, as a rookie, it was a whirlwind of excitement,” Curry said. He added: “The fact that he’s
                    as big as he is, as strong as he is, as skilled as he is, there’s never a time he can’t get a shot
                    off.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    James scored 31 points, most coming from near the rim or at the free-throw line. He hit just one
                    3-pointer.

                    They first met when James attended one of Curry’s college games for Davidson. The night before their
                    first N.B.A. clash, in Cleveland, James hosted Curry at his home.

                    More than a decade later, James’s game looks different, though he can still dunk as if the rim
                    insulted his honor. The N.B.A. has evolved rapidly since James entered the league in 2003, and his
                    ability to change with it helped him break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s seemingly unbreakable career
                    scoring record of 38,387 points on Tuesday. James has 38,390 points now.

                    “Nobody could imagine somebody doing it,” said Drew Gooden, who played hundreds of games alongside
                    James in Cleveland. He added: “If you would have said or told somebody in 2003 when LeBron James got
                    drafted when he was 18 years old that he was going to break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record,
                    they would have looked at you like you were crazy.”
