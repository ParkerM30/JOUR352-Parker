            <p class="description">
                During my time working at Elocen, I performed routine clerical tasks such as mailing, copying, faxing, filing, and scanning, while also screening phone calls, taking messages, and routing them as needed. I assisted principals in drafting and editing memos, reports, and proposals, and actively participated in proposal and bid meetings. I also took part in staff training and development activities that allowed me to build key skills along the way.
